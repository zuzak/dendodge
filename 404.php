<h2>Error 404: Page Not Found</h2>
	The requested page does not exist. It might have been moved or deleted, or nexer existed in the first place&mdash;or maybe I just screwed something up (sorry!). Try one of the following things:
	<ul>
		<li><strong><a href="/">Return to the home page</a></strong> and look for the required resource from there</li>
		<li><strong>Use the navigation links at the top of the page</strong>, and see if one of those goes where you want to be</li>
		<li><strong><a href="?p=sitemap">Check the sitemap</a></strong> for the resource you wanted</li>
		<li><strong>Search for the resource</strong> using the box below (JavaScript required)</li>
		<li>If you got here by following an internal link, please <a href="mailto:george@dendodge.me">email me</a> so I can fix it; unfortunately, there's not a lot I can do about links from other websites, but I'd be very grateful you could get in touch with that site's owner and ask them to fix it</li>
	</ul>
<!-- The search box below breaks validation a teeny bit, but its usefulness is more than worth it, and it degrades gracefully -->
